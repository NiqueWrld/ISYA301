Three Current Methodologies
• There are many specific system development methodologies used in
practice, and this chapter covers three influential ones
• The Unified Process (UP)
• Extreme Programming (XP)
• Scrum
• These methodologies all use an iterative SDLC
• The Unified Process uses UML
• Extreme Programming and Scrum are based on agile principles, but the
Unified Process can also be used in an agile fashion
• Many organizations mix and match features of each of these when
creating their own methodology

The Unified Process (UP)
• Originally developed by Booch, Rumbaugh, and Jacobson, who
previously developed UML at Rational Software (now part of IBM)
• The UP is now widely recognized as a highly influential innovation
in software development methodologies for object-oriented
development using an adaptive approach
• The original version of UP defined an elaborate set of activities and
deliverables for every step of the development process
• More recent versions are streamlined, with fewer activities and
deliverables, simplifying the methodology
• Much of the book’s methodology is loosely based on the Unified
Process (in an agile form)

The Unified Process
Life Cycle
• The Unified Process Life Cycle model includes iterations and
phases (the SDLC in this text is very similar, but left out the UP
phases for simplicity)
• Each UP phase is made up of iterations. The phases are Inception,
Elaboration, Construction, and Transition

The Unified Process
Disciplines
• UP Disciplines – a set of functionally related activities that combine to enable
the development process in a UP project (each like a core development
process):
• Business modeling
• Requirements
• Design
• Implementation
• Testing
• Deployment
• Configuration and change management
• Project management
• Environment

Philosophies/Practices
• Focuses early and often on users
• Use case driven
• Model driven – uses UML exclusively
• Iterative, but provides management structure by defining phases
• Focuses on defining an architecture
• Adaptable to needs of a specific project
• Can be made highly agile, but originally had heavy ceremony

Extreme Programming (XP)
• One of the original agile development methodologies (perhaps a
reaction to the original UP) from Kent Beck
• “Extreme” often thought to be radical, but really just focuses intently on
industry best practices and combines best practices in new ways
• XP is based on core values
• Communication
• Simplicity
• Feedback
• Courage
• XP also defines a set of XP practices

Extreme Programming (XP)
Core Values and Practices

Extreme Programming (XP)
Core Values
• Communication—one of the major causes of project failure is a
lack of open communication among the right players at the right
time and at the right level
• Simplicity—XP includes techniques to reinforce keeping things
simple to make it a standard way of developing systems
• Feedback—as with simplicity, getting frequent, meaningful
feedback is recognized as a best practice of software
development
• Courage—developers always need courage to face the harsh
choice of doing things right or throwing away bad code and
starting over

Extreme Programming (XP)
XP Practices
• Planning—XP planning focuses on making a rough plan quickly and then refining
it as things become clearer. This reflects the Agile development philosophical
dictum that change is more important than detailed plans
• Testing—XP intensifies testing by requiring that the tests for each use case (story)
be written first—before the solution is programmed
• Pair Programming—XP practice in which two programmers work together on
designing, coding, and testing software
• Simple Designs—XP conforms to the principles of Agile Modeling. It
accomplishes the desired result with as few classes and methods as possible and
that doesn’t duplicate code

Extreme Programming (XP)
XP Practices (continued)
• Refactoring the Code— refactoring is the technique of improving the
code without changing what it does. XP programmers continually
refactor their code to achieve a simpler design
• Owning the Code Collectively —in XP, everyone is responsible for the
code. Collective ownership allows anyone to modify any piece of code.
• Continuous Integration —this practice embodies XP’s idea of “growing”
the software. Small pieces of code—which have passed the unit
tests—are integrated into the system daily or even more often
• On-Site Customer —as with all adaptive approaches, XP projects
require continual involvement of users who can make business
decisions about functionality and scope

Extreme Programming (XP)
XP Practices (continued)
• System Metaphor —a system metaphor should be easily understood
and well known to the members of the development team. It can guide
members toward a vision and help them understand the system
• Small Releases —consistent with the entire philosophy of growing the
software, small and frequent releases provide upgraded solutions to
the users and keep them involved in the project
• Forty-Hour Week — the exact number of hours a developer works isn’t
the issue. The issue is that the project shouldn’t be a death march that
burns out every member of the team
• Coding Standards —developers should follow standards for coding and
documentation

Scrum
• Another influential agile, iterative development methodology
based on ideas from Rugby
• A Scrum is used to get a ball back into play after a penalty--it
begins quickly, is a very intense effort, involves the entire team,
and usually only lasts for a short duration
• Scrum philosophy is the complete control a team exerts over its
own organization and its work processes. Software is developed
incrementally, and controls are imposed empirically—by focusing
on things that can be accomplished.

Scrum Organization
• Product backlog – a prioritized list of user requirements used to choose
work to be done in a Scrum project
• Only a few of the high-priority items are worked on at a time
• Product owner – the client stakeholder for whom the system is being
built
• Responsible for project backlog and priorities
• Scrum master – the person in charge of a Scrum project—similar to a
project manager
• Scrum team is usually 5 to 9 people
• Scrum team sets own goals, organizes self, makes decisions

Scrum Practices
• Sprint – a time-controlled mini-project that implements a specific
portion of a system
• Firm 30 day time box with specific goal or deliverable
• The scope of that sprint is then frozen, and no one can change it—neither the
product owner nor any other users
• Sprint backlog defines the scope
• Daily Scrum – a daily meeting of all members of the team to report
progress (15 minutes max)
• Sprint final half-day review meeting – scheduled to review and identify
changes needed for the following sprints

Trends in Technology
Infrastructure
• New Client Computing Devices and Applications –Small, mobile,
connected
• Device-top application – a computer application that is built to execute
on a local device without requiring a client/server connection
• Free-standing Internet application –a client/server application that is self-
contained and doesn’t require the use of a Web browser
• Browser-based application –a client/server application that executes
locally within the control of a Web browser

Trends in Technology
Infrastructure
• Internet and Telephone Communications
• Internet, the telephone, and television are merging
• Long-distance telephone communication and long-distance Internet
communication have very similar requirements and capability
• Internet backbone – the primary data routes between large, strategically
interconnected networks and routers on the Internet
• Last mile – the final leg that delivers connectivity from the Internet
network to the customer

Trends in Technology
Infrastructure
• Back-End Computing –the server computers that provide the content—
dynamic and static—for all applications that access servers through
the Internet
• As more and more client computers try to access a particular application, the
workloads on the servers becomes incredibly heavy
• Several factors are driving the need for large back-end computing services
• Trend toward continuous connectivity to the Internet
• Massive amount of data stored—many applications in the world of commerce keep
a history of all the transactions that occur
• The consolidation of processing in central locations

Data and programs are off the PC and back in
massive data centers

Trends in Application Software
Availability
• Software as a service (SAAS) – a software delivery model similar to
a utility, in which the application and its associated data are
accessed via the Internet without locally installed programs
• Open-source software – a method of developing, delivering, and
licensing software that makes the application source code freely
available to any interested developer or client

Owning Software vs. SAAS

Open Source
Software
Applications

The Web as an Application Platform – The
Evolution

The Web as an Application Platform
• Web 2.0 – a loosely defined, nonstandard term used to refer to
Web sites that permit user-generated content and user
interaction, such as social networking sites
• Plug-ins – a software component that adds specific capabilities to
a larger software application
• Widget – a type of plug-in that focuses on enhancing the user
interface with additional capability (also called gadget)
• Theme – a type of add-on to an application that allows the look
and feel, such as colors and layout, to be changed

(continued)
• Toolbar – a type of add-on usually comprised of iconic menu items
that access the capabilities of the application or plug-ins in a
user-friendly fashion
• Web mini-app – a software application that provides a complete
set of functions but that must be executed within the confines of
another application
• Mashup – a type of Web site that combines the functionality of
several other Web sites through the use of predefined APIs
• Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) –a type of Web site that provides
active user interaction as well as delivers rich multimedia
