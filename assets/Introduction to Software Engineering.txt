What Is Software?
The software is collection of Integrated programs Software consists of carefully organized Computer programs and associated
instructions and code written by programmers in documentation such as requirements, design
any of various special computer languages. models and user manuals.

What Is Engineering?
• Engineering is the application of scientific and practical knowledge in order to
invent, design, build, maintain, and improve systems, processes, etc.

What is software Engineering?
• Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all
aspects of software production.
• According to IEEE's definition software engineering can be defined as the
application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development,
operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that
is, the application of engineering to software.

Need of Software Engineering
• Handling Big Projects: Corporation must use SE to handle large projects without
any issues.
• To manage the cost: Software engineering programmers plan everything and
reduce all those things that are not required.
• To decrease time: It will save a lot of time if you are developing software using a
software engineering technique.
• Reliable software: It is the company's responsibility to deliver software products
on schedule and to address any defects that may exist.
• Effectiveness: Effectiveness results from things being created in accordance with
the software standards.

Characteristics
of Good
Software

General issues that affect software
• Heterogeneity
• Business and social change
• Security and trust
• Scale

Software products
Software:
• “Computing systems and documentation. Software products may be developed for a
particular customer (custom) or may be developed for a general market (generic)”
Software engineering:
• “Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects
of software production

Nature of Software
1. System Software: System software is software designed to provide a platform
for other software’s.
• It is a interaction between hardware & application software.
• Examples: Operating Systems like macOS, Linux, Android and Microsoft
Windows.
2. Application Software: Application Software is a computer program designed to
carry out a specific task as per user & business need.
• Examples: Social medias apps, Gaming apps, Word processing apps,
Multimedia apps, Banking apps, Shopping apps, Booking apps etc

Nature of Software
3. Engineering and Scientific Software: This software is used to facilitate the
engineering function and task take real time.
• It has very high accuracy, complex formula evolution & data analysis.
• Examples: Weather prediction apps, Stock Market apps, Stress Analysis, Body
measurement apps
4. Embedded Software: Embedded software resides within the system or product
and is used to implement and control feature and function for the end-user and for
the system itself.
• Example: Switches, Routers, Digital camera, Washing machine functionalities,
Traffic control

Nature of Software
5. Web Applications: It is a client-server computer program which the client runs on
the web browser.
• Web apps can be little more than a set of linked hypertext files that present
information using text and limited graphics.
• Examples: Online forms, Shopping carts, Gmail, Yahoo, Photo editing, File
conversion etc.
6. Artificial Intelligence Software: It makes use of a nonnumerical algorithm to solve a
complex problem.
• Application within this area includes robotics, expert system, pattern
recognition, artificial neural network, theorem proving and game playing.
• Examples: Google Cloud, Azure studio, Tensor Flow, Salesforce etc.

Software engineering fundamentals
• Planed and managed development process
• Software must behave as expected, always available and work without failure
(dependable).
• Efficient use of resources (performance).
• Manage stakeholder expectations (requirements)
• Manage software reuse

Changing Nature of Software
WebApps
• Semantic web technologies(Web3.0)
• Semantic databases; web linking; flexible data representation; and application
programmer interfaces(API’s)
Mobile Apps
• Can gain direct access to the hardware found on the device to provide local
processing and storage capabilities
Cloud Computing
• Cloud computing provides distributed data storage and processing resources to
networked computing devices

Changing Nature of Software
Product Line Software
• A software product line shares a set of assets that include requirements,
architecture, design patterns, reusable components, test cases and other work
products
Service orientated software
• Software system is composed of standalone web-services
Rich internet interfaces
• AJAX and HTML5

Software engineering ethics
Software engineers must behave in an honest and ethically
• Be respected as professionals
• Ethical behavior is more than simply upholding the law
• involves following a set of principles that are morally correct.
• Respect Confidentiality of employers and clients
• Not accept work outside your Competence
• Protect the intellectual property of employers and clients
• Not use technical skills to misuse other people’s computers
• ACM/IEEE maintain code of ethics and processional practice

Software Process Activities
• A software process is the set of activities and associated outcome that produce a
software product.
• Software engineers mostly carry out these activities.
1. Software Specifications: The functionality of the software and constraints on its
operation must be defined
2. Software Development: The software to meet the requirement must be
produced.
3. Software Validation: The software must be validated to ensure that it does what
the customer wants.
4. Software Evolution: The software must evolve to meet changing client needs.
