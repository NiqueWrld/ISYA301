Software Quality
• The quality of software can be defined as the ability of the software to function as per user
requirements.
• When it comes to software products, they must satisfy all the functionalities written down
in the SRS document.
Software Quality includes:
-Good Design: Good visualization design to attract users.
-Durability: The software works without any issue for a long period of time.
-Consistency: Software performs consistently on different platforms and other devices.
-Maintainability: Capture and fix bugs quickly. New features are added easily.
-Value for money: Customers & companies who make this app should feel that the money
spent on this app was not wasted.

Three principles concerns of software quality
• At the organizational level, quality management is concerned with
establishing a framework of organizational processes and standards that
will lead to high-quality software.
• At the project level, quality management involves the application of
specific quality processes and checking that these planned processes
have been followed.
• At the project level, quality management is also concerned with
establishing a quality plan for a project. The quality plan should set out
the quality goals for the project and define what processes and standards
are to be used.

Quality plans
➢ A quality plan is a document that outlines the strategy, scope, processes,
resources, and goals for ensuring that software products meet the required
quality standards. It acts as a roadmap for the entire software development and
testing process to ensure that the software delivered to customers meets both
functional and non-functional requirements, is reliable and secure, and
performs as expected.
➢Quality plan structure
• Product introduction
• Product plans
• Process descriptions
• Quality goals
• Risks and risk management
➢Quality plans should be short, succinct(Compact and Precise) documents
• If they are too long, no one will read them.

Product introduction
• This section provides an overview of the product or service being
developed or delivered.
• It typically includes the product’s purpose, key features,
specifications, and target market.
• The introduction sets the context for the quality management
process, emphasizing how quality is essential to meeting the
product's objectives and customer expectations.

Product plans
• Product plans outline the roadmap for the development, testing,
and delivery of the product.
• It includes detailed timelines, milestones, and the resources
required for successful product realization.
• This section focuses on defining the stages of product
development, such as design, prototype, production, and launch,
while ensuring quality is integrated at every stage

Process descriptions
• This section provides detailed descriptions of the processes
involved in product development and production.
• It typically includes process flows, standard operating procedures
(SOPs), and instructions for how tasks should be performed.
• The goal is to ensure that the processes are clearly defined,
repeatable, and efficient, with a focus on consistent quality
control throughout.

Quality goals
• Quality goals are the measurable objectives that the organization
aims to achieve during the product's lifecycle.
• These goals could be related to product performance, customer
satisfaction, defect rates, compliance, or other relevant metrics.
The quality goals should be aligned with both the organization’s
strategic objectives and customer requirements.
• They act as benchmarks for measuring and driving quality
improvements.

Risks and risk management
• This section identifies potential risks that could impact product
quality, timelines, or customer satisfaction.
• Risks can be related to technical challenges, resource limitations,
market fluctuations, or regulatory compliance.
• The risk management plan outlines how each risk will be
assessed, prioritized, and mitigated.
• This includes specifying risk owners, defining mitigation
strategies, and monitoring risks throughout the product
development lifecycle to ensure that quality standards are
maintained.

Non-functional requirements to assess
quality of software
• Maintainability: The ease with which software can be modified (adding features,
enhancing features, fixing bugs, etc.)
• Portability: The ability of software to be transferred easily from one location to
another.
• Functionality: The ability of software to carry out the functions as specified or
desired.
• Performance: The speed at which software performs under a particular load.
• Compatibility: The suitability of software for use in different environments like
different devices, operating systems, and browsers.
• Usability: The degree of software's ease of use.
• Reliability: The ability of software to perform a required function under stated
conditions without any errors.
• Security: The extent of protection of software against unauthorized access, invasion
of privacy, theft. loss of data etc. Ex. OTP

Software Quality Management
• Software Quality Management (SQM) refers to the complete process that
ensures a software product is developed as per national and international
standards like ANSI, IEEE, and ISO.
Need for Software Quality Management:
1. Deliver high-quality products on time.
2. Increases stakeholder faith in product & company.
3. High-quality products always ensure customer satisfaction.

Activities of Software Quality
Management

How to Achieve Software Quality?
➢Quality Planning:
• Select applicable procedures and standards for a particular project and
modify them as required to develop a quality plan.
➢Quality Assurance:
• It assures that the system meets specified requirements and customer
expectations.
• It defines standards and methodologies for a successful development
process.
• It assures Correctness, Efficiency, Flexibility, Maintainability, Portability,
Usability, etc.
➢Quality Control:
• It focuses on achieving & fulfilling quality parameters or quality goals as per
customer requirements.
• It focuses on delivering products on time with accurate cost.

Software Quality Metrics
Software Quality Management makes sure that the software is high-quality and follows
proper rules and standards. To check how good the software is, we use different types
of metrics (measurements):
Customer Problem Metrics:
• Measure the problems encountered by the customers while using the product.
• Problems per User Month = (Total Number of Problem Reports) / (Total Number of Users *
Number of Months)
• For example, if you have 10 problem reports, 100 users, and you're tracking data for 1
month, the problems per user month would be 10 / (100 * 1) = 0.1.
Customer Satisfaction Metrics:
• It deals with the overall quality of the product & how much a customer is satisfied with
that product.
• It is measured by Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied, and Very Dissatisfied.
Software Maintenance Metrics:
• After completion of Development & Testing product release in the market.
• During this interval. How many defect arrived at customer environment?

Reviews and inspections
➢A group examines part or all of a process or system and its
documentation to find potential problems.
➢Software or documents may be 'signed off' at a review, which
signifies that progress to the next development stage has been
approved by management.
➢There are different types of reviews with different objectives
➢Quality reviews (product and standards)
➢Inspections for defect removal (product)
➢Reviews for progress assessment (product and process)

Quality reviews
➢A group of people carefully examines part or all of a software
system and its associated documentation.
➢ Code, designs, specifications, test plans, standards, etc., can all
be reviewed.
➢Software or documents may be 'signed off' at a review, which
signifies that progress to the next development stage has been
approved by management.

Phases in the review process
➢Pre-review activities
➢Pre-review activities are concerned with review planning and review
preparation
➢The review meeting
➢During the review meeting, an author of the document or program being
reviewed should ‘walk through’ the document with the review team.
➢Post-review activities
➢These address the problems and issues that have been raised during the
review meeting.

The software review process

Program inspections
➢These are peer reviews where engineers examine the source of a
system with the aim of discovering anomalies and defects.
➢Inspections do not require execution of a system so may be used
before implementation.
➢They may be applied to any representation of the system
(requirements, design, configuration data, test data, etc.).
➢They have been shown to be an effective technique for
discovering program errors.

Inspection checklists
➢Checklist of common errors should be used to drive the
inspection.
➢Error checklists are programming language dependent and reflect
the characteristic errors that are likely to arise in the language.
➢In general, the 'weaker' the type checking, the larger the checklist.
➢Examples: Initialisation, Constant naming, loop
termination, array bounds, etc.
