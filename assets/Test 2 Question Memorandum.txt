Question Four: Short Questions [20 Marks]
4.1 Mention the four phases of the Unified Process. [1x4]
Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition
4.2 Read the scenarios below (from 4.2.1 to 4.2.4) and indicate which XP core value is
described by each scenario? [2x4]
4..2.1 Despite tight deadlines, the team insists on writing automated tests and doing
continuous integration to maintain a high-quality standard.
Courage.
4.2.2 The team pushes small changes to production frequently to get rapid feedback and
ensure nothing breaks unexpectedly.
Feedback.
4.2.3 A developer pair frequently communicates with the customer to ensure the software
matches their needs and quickly adjusts based on feedback.
Communication.
4.2.4 A team member notices inefficiency in the codebase and proactively suggests
refactoring the code for better maintainability.
Simplicity
4.3 You are tasked with improving the user interface of a traditional web-based form. Suggest
any 3 Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) tools you might use. [1x3]
• JavaScript and Ajax Libraries
• ICEFaces and JavaFX
4

• Adobe Flash Platform
• Microsoft Silverlight
• HTML5
4.4 List 5 of the practices of the Unified Process. [5]
• Focuses early and often on users
• Use case driven
• Model-driven – uses UML exclusively
• Iterative, but provides management structure by defining phases
• Focuses on defining architecture
• Adaptable to the needs of a specific project
Question Five: Scenario [15 Marks]
Read the scenario below and answer the questions that follows.
A mid-sized software development company is creating a hospital management system with
strict compliance requirements. During early development, testers report that modules are
failing integration tests. Additionally, the project manager notices that several quality
standards agreed upon in the planning phase are not being consistently followed. The client
has expressed concerns about system reliability and maintainability. The QA team currently
only performs testing at the end of each major milestone, and there is no formal quality audit
process in place.
5.1 Identify two key issues related to software quality management in this scenario. [2x2]
Quality Assurance (QA): Quality standards agreed upon in the planning phase are not
being consistently followed
Quality Control (QC): Testers report that modules are failing integration tests
bugs accumulate unnoticed until late stages, compromising product reliability and
increasing rework costs.

5.2 In the context of software quality management, one key metric used to assess customer
satisfaction and product reliability is the Customer Problem Metric. State the formula used to
calculate this metric. [3]
Problems per User Month = (Total Number of Problem Reports) / (Total Number of
Users * Number of Months)
5.3 How does a software quality plan support risk management in software development? [2]
The risk management plan outlines how each risk will be assessed, prioritized,
and mitigated. This includes specifying risk owners, defining mitigation
strategies, and monitoring risks throughout the product development lifecycle to
ensure that quality standards are maintained.
5.4 Reviews are a key component of software quality management, helping to detect defects
early in the software development lifecycle. Mention and define these three phases in the
review process. [2x3]
Pre-review activities are concerned with review planning and review preparation.
The review meeting: During the review meeting, the author of the document or program
being reviewed should ‘walk through’ the document with the review team.
Post-review activities: These address the problems and issues that have been raised
during the review meeting.
